In addition to experience, I was also lucky enough to acquire a precious thing. This is a gold ring. Every year it becomes something more important to me. Every evening I spend a lot of time with it and sometimes travel - thanks to it I can be invisible. After such walks, I hide it in a secret place where no one can get to. And if he can, then a small surprise will await him there! Small but very charming... After this meeting, the thief will not be able to take my precious away from me."
