In addition to experience, I was also lucky enough to acquire a precious thing. This is a gold ring. Every year it becomes something more important to me. Every evening I spend a lot of time with it and sometimes travel - thanks to it I can be invisible."

Но ещё мне всё же удалось прихватить с собой одну достаточно ценную вещичку - золотое кольцо! С каждым годом оно становится для меня чем-то более особенным! Я нахожу в нём необъяснимую прелесть. Каждое утро я провожу с ним много времени, делая прогулки - очень кстати благодаря нему я могу быть невидим."
