In addition to experience, I was also lucky enough to acquire a precious thing. This is a gold ring. Every year it becomes something more important to me.

Ќо еще мне все же удалось прихватить с собой одну достаточно ценную вещичку - золотое кольцо! — каждым годом оно становитьс€ дл€ мен€ чем-то более особенным! я нахожу в нем необъ€снимую прелесть.  аждое утро € провожу с ним много времени, дела€ прогулки - очень кстати благодар€ нему € могу быть невидим."
