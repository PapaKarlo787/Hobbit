Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly things! That was a real journey... Me and dwarves were captured by them and they are put us to bags - we can't do any move. So, there I was... at the mercy of three monstrous trolls... And they're arguing... arguing about how they were going to cook us!\n<p>\nWhether it be turned on a spit or minced in a pie or whether they were going to sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly! But they spent so long arguing the whether-to's and why-for's that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees... and turned them all to stone!"

Ёто было насто€щим приключением... я с гномами был пойман трем€ тролл€ми, они посадили нас в мешки - мы не могли пошевелитьс€.\n<p>\n» вот € осталс€ один на один с трем€ ужасными тролл€ми! » они стали спорить между собой, как же им приготовить нас - зажарить живьем или сесть на нас и раздавить, как тараканов. ќни столько времени спорили, взвешива€ все "«а" и "ѕротив", что первый луч солнца прокразлс€ из-за кромки деревьев... и все они обратились в камень!"
