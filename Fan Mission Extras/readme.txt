Briefing:
My friend Basso gave me information that the hobbit Bilbo Baggins lives in a hole under the Hill.
Rumor has it that he has a huge pile of all sorts of good, which he brought with him after he disappeared
for a year with a magician and dwarves. I also heard rumors that he keeps a very expensive and cute little
thing that I could attach to the right place... Now he is away visiting his friend Elrond the elf.
The house is carefully guarded, I must not get seen, otherwise I will be caught not now then later!
